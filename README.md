Generalized Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) Builder for Devices with Discrete Random Outcomes
Overview:

This Python program builds and visualizes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for systems with a finite number of random outcomes, based on a user-defined number of outcomes and associated probabilities. The program allows users to specify the precision, number of outcomes, and the method of inputting probabilities (either manually or interactively). It simulates a Cantor-like function, computes various statistical properties (e.g., integral, arclength), and provides an interactive plot of the CDF.

Features:

Generalized CDF: Builds a CDF for discrete outcomes based on user-specified probabilities.
Iterative Probability Input: Users can input probabilities either manually in the script or interactively through the terminal.
Precision Control: The precision of calculations can be set, allowing high-precision results.
Visualization: Generates a graph of the CDF, including the curve and a reference line (y=x), with additional statistical information (e.g., integral, arclength).
Statistical Analysis: Computes and displays integral, arclength, number of intersections, and the area between the CDF curve and the reference line (y=x).
